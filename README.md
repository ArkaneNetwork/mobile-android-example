# Example: Building a (native) mobile app with Arkane<img align="right" src="https://github.com/ArkaneNetwork.png?size=30" />
> Building your own native mobile application (Android) which will interact with a blockchain using [Arkane](https://arkane.network).


## What you’ll build
We’ll build a small application which will:

* Authenticate the user with Arkane (OAuth2)
* Enable the user to manage his wallets connected to our application
* Fetch a list of the user’s wallets

You can find the complete quickstart guide [here](https://docs.arkane.network/pages/mobile-multi-chain-wallet.html)
